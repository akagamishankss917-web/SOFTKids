# SOFT Kids Adventure — handoff

**Live:** https://akagamishankss917-web.github.io/SOFTKids/
**Repo:** https://github.com/akagamishankss917-web/SOFTKids (`main` = source, `gh-pages` = the deployed site)

Open `soft-kids-game/index.html` in any browser and it just runs. That one file
*is* the game — no build step, no server, no dependencies. On a phone, "Add to
home screen" installs it as an app that works with no signal.

## What it is

Title → **pick a kid** → the barangay reshapes around them.

Five pickable kids: **Eya, Jeya, Gab, Tia, Timmy.**

`State.hero` is the only switch in the game. The household containing that kid is
**home**: you spawn in front of it, it holds the wardrobe and the food tray, and
your parents are inside. Pick **Tia** and her brother **Timmy** is standing there
to hug — and the other way round. Everyone else's house is a **visit**: their
toys, their family, no wardrobe, no food tray. **Tito Boy** has a house and no
kids, so he is never pickable but always visitable.

Wardrobe is gender-split — 10 girl items, 6 boy items. Each kid **starts in their
own clothes**, taken from their real photo; the wardrobe only overrides a slot
once you pick something. Outfits save per kid.

## Things to play with

**Indoors** — a basketball hoop you shoot at (arc, swish, confetti), a piano that
plays a tune, a bubble jar, a bouncy ball, plus the drums, blocks, dolls, cake,
cat, robot, guitar, TV, binoculars and watering can from before. At **home**
there is also a bed: tap it and the lights dim, Zzz float up, a lullaby plays,
and you get tucked in.

**Outdoors** — a barangay basketball court past the mall, a football to boot
across the field, a bubble machine, the tricycle you can ride, a kite, a dog, a
jump rope, a butterfly you can chase but never catch, and the playground (slide,
swing, seesaw, sandbox, beach ball). **Tap the sun** and night falls — stars,
fireflies, a crescent moon. Tap the moon for morning.

**At the venues** — a shape sorter at school, handbells at church (C-E-G-C; ring
all four and the choir applauds), and a checkout at S&R where you scan the
groceries. **SM has two floors:** tap the escalator (the "2F" sign) to ride up
to the arcade, where a claw machine drops its claw, grabs a plushie and rains
confetti; the "1F" escalator rides back down. Tito Boy's **camera takes real
photos**: it rasterizes the live scene to a JPEG and keeps the last eight in a
polaroid album.

## The sticker book

The reward loop. Sixteen slots, one per activity, saved per kid
(`soft-stickers-<kid>`). An empty slot is a dashed circle with a "?"; earning one
drops a clay card in from the top. The star button on the map and in the house
opens the book; a camera chip inside it opens the photo album.

Stickers are awarded from `Stickers.award(id)` calls sprinkled at the moment each
activity *completes* — never on a tap. The module is self-wiring: it installs one
delegated capture-phase listener, so a scene only has to render
`Stickers.buttonSVG()`.

## Quests

A wish bubble bobs over the hero's own house. Tap it and someone at home asks for
three of something (mangoes, flowers, chicks — the template rotates); the three
glow somewhere along the barangay, and finding them all earns confetti and the
Tulong sticker. `Scenes.map.installQuest()`.

## The two bugs that mattered

Both were inherited from the source game and both are fixed and verified:

- **`makeDraggable` counted any pointer movement as a drag.** A toddler's tap with
  a pixel of jitter yanked the toy out from under their finger and played a drop
  sound. It now uses a 12px threshold — the same one characters already had. A tap
  is a tap: it wobbles and squeaks, nothing is picked up.
- **Overlap.** Props sat in a layer *under* every character and the hero drew over
  everyone, so a toy dragged onto a person vanished behind them and a resident
  standing closer still drew behind the hero. Everything that stands on the floor
  now shares one `#depthLayer`, sorted by ground Y (painter's algorithm). Sorting
  happens on drop, not every frame: what you're holding is raised to the front,
  and settles into its true depth when you let go.

## Design

Built to the **ui-ux-pro-max** skill's design system, which picked
**Claymorphism** for a children's game: soft 3D, chunky, toy-like. Its checklist
named the two things that made the game look cheap, and both were true:

- **Emoji as icons** → one vector icon set on a 24px grid (`ICON_PATHS`, `icon()`).
  Emoji that remain are *content* illustrations inside venues (shop goods, a
  storybook picture), not controls.
- **Comic Sans** → **Fredoka**, embedded as a woff2 data-URI so the game still
  runs offline from one file.

Every control is a `clayButton()` that squashes on press (CSS `:active` on
`.clayPress`, 140ms spring). Characters have contact shadows. Interiors have lit
walls and receding floorboards (`roomDefs()` for houses, `venueRoom()` for the
four venues). `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected — SMIL is paused by hand in
`applyMotionPreference()`, since it ignores the CSS media query.

**Nothing stands still.** Every character breathes and sways on its own random
period (the inner `.rig` group), so a room never moves in lockstep. Pick one up
and it dangles like a pendulum against the direction you drag, then springs
upright when you let go. Scenes change through an iris wipe, not a cut.

The last content emoji are gone. `MINI_ART` is a kit of small drawn pictograms
(shelf goods, storybook pictures, the alphabet chart, mall displays) and
`packSVG()` generates grocery packaging in four shapes. Emoji rendered
differently on every phone and could never be recoloured to match the room.

## How the pieces fit

- `soft-kids-game/index.html` — the whole game. The **CONTENT** banner near the
  top holds `GAME`, `CHARACTERS`, `HOUSEHOLDS`. Below it the engine never names a
  child; it reads `State.hero`.
- `tools/make_faces.py` — walks `households/`, crops each face with a hand-tuned
  box, injects them as base64 between the `FACES:BEGIN/END` markers.
- `tools/make_icons.py` — the PWA icons.
- `households/` — the cast, as folders. **Git-ignored**: the full-resolution
  photos never leave this machine. Only the 176px crops embedded in the game ship.

### Adding a sixth kid

1. `households/<Name>/<Name>.jpg` plus a `Parents/` folder.
2. A `FACE_CROPS` line in `tools/make_faces.py`, then re-run it.
3. A `CHARACTERS` entry (needs `gender` to be pickable) and a `HOUSEHOLDS` line.

No map coordinates. `layoutHouses()` places the house, picks its colour, widens
the world and pushes the town east. The pick screen wraps to a second row.

> ⚠️ **The FACES block is generated.** If you ever bulk find-and-replace across
> `index.html`, re-run `make_faces.py` afterwards — a rename silently corrupted
> the `eya` face key once and turned her into a cartoon until it was regenerated.

> ⚠️ **Close `index.html` in VS Code before running the tools.** An open editor
> tab wrote back a stale buffer once and undid the font embed.

## Debug entry points

`#pick`, `#lineup`, `#map`, `#house-<id>`, `#place-<id>`, `#dressup`.
Append `=<kid>` to choose who you are: `#house-debs=timmy`, `#dressup=gab`.
House ids: `eya`, `jeya`, `gab`, `debs`, `boy`. Places: `school`, `church`,
`snr`, `sm`, `sm2` (the SM 2nd floor / arcade).

## Verifying a change

`scratchpad/shots.mjs` drives the real game in headless Chromium across all 15
scenes and asserts the semantics (friend houses have no wardrobe, the boy and
girl racks differ, siblings appear). `depth.mjs` drags a toy behind a person and
checks it draws behind her. Latest run: **no page errors**.

## Deploying

`main` is the source. The site is the `soft-kids-game/` folder published to the
root of `gh-pages`:

```
git subtree push --prefix soft-kids-game origin gh-pages
```

GitHub Pages serves `gh-pages` / root. `sw.js` caches aggressively — bump `CACHE`
in it when shipping, or returning phones keep the old build.

## Known rough edges

- Characters glide when they move; there is no walk cycle (no leg swing). Nothing
  looks broken, but a two-frame swing would sell the motion.
- Characters glide when they move on the SM 2nd floor too — the walk-cycle gap
  applies everywhere.
- The SM arcade's claw machine always "wins" (it's for toddlers) and awards no
  sticker — the 16-slot book is full, so a 17th would overflow its fixed 4×4
  panel. If the book is ever re-laid-out to hold more, the arcade is the natural
  place to hang a new one.
